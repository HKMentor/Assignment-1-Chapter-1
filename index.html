    <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
    <p>
      <b
        >Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human
        intelligence in machines. These systems are designed to learn from data,
        recognize patterns, and make decisions, often performing tasks that
        would typically require human intervention, such as speech recognition
        and decision-making.</b

    <h2>Applications of AI in Daily Life</h2>
    <p>
      <strong
        >AI is integrated into many aspects of modern life. From virtual
        assistants like Siri and Google Assistant to self-driving cars and
        recommendation algorithms on platforms like Netflix, AI helps improve
        efficiency and personalization in our daily routines</strong
      >
    </p>
    <h2>Challenges and Concerns</h2>
    <p>
     While AI offers numerous benefits, it also brings challenges, including
        concerns about privacy, job displacement due to automation, and the
        ethical implications of creating systems that can think and act
        independently. Balancing AI advancements with ethical guidelines is
        essential for responsible development.
